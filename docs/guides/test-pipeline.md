title: Test a pipeline
---

Test your pipeline locally by running the following anywhere in your project

```bash
katoa run <pipeline>
```

**Note:** You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) &
[deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.32.3/getting_started/installation)
installed to test your pipelines locally

The first run will be a little slow as there is no caching. But afterwards it should be plenty fast!
