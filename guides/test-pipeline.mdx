title: Test a pipeline
---

Test your pipeline locally by running the following anywhere in your project

```bash
cicada run <pipeline>
```

<em>
  Note: You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) &
  [deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.32.3/getting_started/installation)
  installed to test your pipelines locally
</em>

The first run will be a little slow as there is no caching. But afterwards it should be plenty fast!

  Deploy your pipeline to Cicada's cloud so it runs on every commit and PR
