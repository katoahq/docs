Cicada is a CI/CD platform. Use our TypeScript SDK to write pipelines, test them locally, then run them on every PR in our ultra-fast cloud

Here's how to build, test, and deploy your own Cicada pipeline in under < 2 minutes.

## 1. Download the `cicada` CLI

<Snippet file="install-cli.mdx" />

## 2. Create a new pipeline

Navigate to a project and run

```bash
cicada init
```

This will create a simple example pipeline at `.cicada/my-pipeline.ts` that looks like [this](/guides/pipeline-examples/starter)

## 3. Test your pipeline locally

Test changes to your pipelines locally using the `cicada` CLI

```bash
cicada run my-pipeline
```

## 4. Create a Cicada Account

Sign up at [cicada.build/dashboard](https://cicada.build/dashboard)

## 5. Link your repository

Link your repository from step #2. Cicada will now run your pipelines on every commit / PR to your linked repos.

## 6. Push your pipeline to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat:added cicada pipeline"
git push origin main
```

## 7. View your pipeline logs

Now go to [cicada.build/dashboard](https://cicada.build/dashboard) and watch your pipeline logs live!

## 6. That's it!
